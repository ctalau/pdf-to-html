<h2>ACME Corporation Technical Reference Manual</h2>
<p>Version 2.1 | February 2026 | Document ID: TRM-2026-021</p>
<h2>Overview and Introduction</h2>
<p>The  ACME  Corporation  Technical  Reference  Manual  serves  as  a  comprehensive  guide  to system  architecture,  configuration  options,  and  operational  procedures.  This  document  is intended  for  system  administrators,  technical  staff,  and  integrators  who  require  detailed knowledge of ACME systems. All information herein is considered proprietary and confidential.</p>
<p>This  manual  is  organized  into  logical  sections  covering  system  fundamentals,  installation procedures,  configuration  guidelines,  and  troubleshooting  methodologies.  Each  section  is designed to be self-contained while maintaining cross-references to related topics. Users are encouraged to reference the table of contents and index when seeking information on specific topics.</p>
<p>The  following  conventions  are  used  throughout  this  document:  system  names  appear  in monospaced  font ,  user  actions  are  indicated  with  bold  text,  and  important  notes  are highlighted with special formatting.</p>
<h2>System Architecture</h2>
<h2>Core Components</h2>
<p>The ACME  system  architecture  comprises  five  primary  components  that  work  in  concert  to deliver  enterprise-grade  functionality.  The  integration  of  these  components  creates  a  robust, scalable platform suitable for organizations of varying sizes.</p>
<p>Component specifications are outlined in the following table:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><th>Component</th><th>Version</th><th>Memory (GB)</th><th>Storage</th><th>Purpose</th></tr><tr><td>Central Controller</td><td>3.2.1</td><td>32</td><td>2TB SSD</td><td>Primary orchestration and management</td></tr><tr><td>Processing Node A</td><td>3.2.1</td><td>64</td><td>4TB SSD</td><td>Computational workload processing</td></tr><tr><td>Processing Node B</td><td>3.2.1</td><td>64</td><td>4TB SSD</td><td>Redundant computational capacity</td></tr><tr><td>Storage Gateway</td><td>2.8.4</td><td>16</td><td>10TB HDD</td><td>Data archival and retrieval</td></tr><tr><td>Monitor Agent</td><td>1.5.2</td><td>8</td><td>500GB SSD</td><td>System health and telemetry</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h2>Network Configuration</h2>
<p>Network  connectivity  is  critical  to  system  performance.  All  components  communicate  via dedicated Gigabit Ethernet connections with redundancy provided through dual network paths. The  system  supports  both  IPv4  and  IPv6  protocols.  VLANs  are  configured  to  segregate management, operational, and backup traffic.</p>
<p>The following network segments are defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management VLAN (192.168.1.0/24): Administrative access and system management</li>
<li>Operations VLAN (192.168.2.0/24): Primary data processing and inter-component communication</li>
<li>Backup VLAN (192.168.3.0/24): Redundant connections and failover mechanisms</li>
<li>External VLAN (192.168.4.0/24): Client-facing interfaces and external connectivity</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation and Configuration</h2>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before beginning installation, ensure the following prerequisites are met. Failure to meet these requirements may result in system instability or degraded performance.</p>
<p>Required hardware includes:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '1. ';">Minimum 4 dedicated physical servers with IPMI support</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '2. ';">Dedicated network switch with VLAN capability</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '3. ';">Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) with minimum 30-minute runtime</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '4. ';">Climate-controlled data center environment (15-25°C, 30-70% humidity)</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '5. ';">Backup storage system with redundant connectivity</li>
</ol>
<h2>Installation Procedures</h2>
<p>The installation process requires approximately 4-6 hours depending on environment complexity.  Each  step  must  be  completed  in  the  specified  order  to  ensure  proper  system initialization and component recognition.</p>
<p>Step-by-step installation includes physical component  placement, network configuration, software  deployment,  and  system  validation.  After  each  major  phase,  system  diagnostics should be executed to verify proper operation before proceeding to the next phase.</p>
<h2>Operations and Monitoring</h2>
<h2>Daily Operations</h2>
<p>Daily operational tasks include system health checks, performance monitoring, and log review. The monitoring dashboard provides real-time visibility into all critical metrics. Operators should establish a regular review schedule to ensure proactive identification of potential issues.</p>
<p>Key  operational  metrics  to  monitor  include  CPU  utilization,  memory  availability,  disk  I/O performance,  network  throughput,  and  component  health  status.  Thresholds  should  be configured to generate alerts when metrics exceed acceptable parameters.</p>
<h2>Performance Optimization</h2>
<p>System performance can be optimized through careful tuning of configuration parameters. The most  significant  performance  improvements  are  typically  realized  through  database  query optimization  and  network  bandwidth  management.  Regular  capacity  planning  assessments should be conducted to ensure resources remain adequate for operational requirements.</p>
<p>Performance tuning should be approached methodically, with changes implemented one at a time and results documented. This approach simplifies troubleshooting if unexpected behavior occurs after optimization attempts.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting and Support</h2>
<h2>Common Issues and Solutions</h2>
<p>This  section  addresses  the  most  frequently  encountered  problems  and  their  resolution procedures. For issues not covered here, consult the detailed error code reference in Appendix A.</p>
<p>Most operational issues can be resolved through systematic troubleshooting:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '1. ';">Verify network connectivity between all components</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '2. ';">Check system logs for error messages and warnings</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '3. ';">Validate configuration settings against documentation</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '4. ';">Execute diagnostic utilities to identify component failures</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '5. ';">Escalate to engineering support if issue persists</li>
</ol>
<h2>Escalation Procedures</h2>
<p>When issues cannot be resolved through standard troubleshooting, escalation to ACME support is available. Escalation should include detailed system  logs, configuration export,  and reproduction steps. Premium  support contracts provide expedited response times  and dedicated engineering support.</p>
<h2>Maintenance and Updates</h2>
<p>Regular maintenance is essential for system reliability and security. Software updates should be applied  within  30  days  of  release,  with  emergency  security  patches  applied  immediately. Hardware  maintenance  follows  manufacturer  guidelines  with  routine  component  replacement performed during scheduled maintenance windows.</p>
<p>The system supports rolling updates without requiring complete shutdown, allowing maintenance to be performed during standard business hours. Detailed procedures for updates are documented in the Operations Guide with step-by-step instructions and rollback procedures.</p>
<h2>Security Considerations</h2>
<p>System  security  is  paramount  in  any  production  environment.  ACME  systems  implement multiple  layers  of  security  controls  including  authentication,  encryption,  access  controls,  and audit logging. All data in transit is encrypted using industry-standard protocols, and data at rest is protected through encrypted storage volumes.</p>
<p>Access  to  the  system  is  controlled  through  role-based  access  controls  (RBAC)  with  users assigned  specific  permissions  based  on  job  function.  Regular  security  audits  should  be conducted to verify compliance with organizational security policies and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>This  concludes  the  technical  reference  manual.  For  additional  information,  please  contact ACME Support at support@acme.example.com or call 1-800-ACME-SUPPORT.</p>
