<h2><strong>Superscript</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Subscript</strong> <strong>Demonstration</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Mathematical</strong> <strong>Expressions</strong></p>

<p>The Pythagorean theorem states that <em>a</em> <em>2</em> <em>+</em> <em>b</em> <em>2</em> <em>=</em> <em>c,</em> <em>2</em> where c is the hypotenuse. Einstein&#x27;s equation <em>E</em> <em>=</em> <em>mc</em> <em>2</em> expresses the equivalence of mass and energy.</p>

<p>The area of a circle is A = πr 2 , and the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr 3 . For compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n) nt .</p>

<p>The n th partial sum of a geometric series S = a(1 − r)/(1 n − r). Logarithm: log(8) = 3. n 2</p>

<p><strong>Chemical</strong> <strong>Formulae</strong></p>

<p>Water has the formula H O. Carbon dioxide is CO . Sulfuric acid is H SO , and glucose is C H O . 2 2 2 4 6 12 6 Ethanol is C H OH and ammonia is NH . 2 5 3 Combustion of methane: CH + 2O → CO + 2HO. Photosynthesis: 6CO + 6HO → CHO + 4 2 2 2 2 2 6 12 6 6O . 2</p>

<p><strong>Ordinal</strong> <strong>Numbers</strong></p>

<p>She finished in 1 st place. The 2 nd runner-up received silver. By the 3 rd quarter the team secured the championship. Our 100 th customer received a special prize on the company&#x27;s 21 st anniversary.</p>

<p>The study found significant correlations between sleep deprivation and cognitive performance. [1] Participants sleeping fewer than six hours showed worse memory results. [2] These findings align with circadian rhythm research [3] and support the hypothesis that deep sleep consolidates memories. [4]</p>
