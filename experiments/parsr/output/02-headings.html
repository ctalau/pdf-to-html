Headings should follow a logical sequence from h1 to h6, creating clear visual and structural distinctions between content sections. <strong>Secondary</strong> <strong>Section</strong> <strong>Structure</strong> This heading level is useful for organizing subsections within your main content areas. It provides a clear visual distinction while maintaining readability and document flow. <strong>Tertiary</strong> <strong>Information</strong> <strong>Grouping</strong> The h4 heading level allows for further subdivision of content. It is particularly useful in longer documents where multiple levels of organization are needed to maintain clarity. <strong>Lesser-Used</strong> <strong>Heading</strong> <strong>Levels</strong> Heading levels five and six are available for highly structured documents with many levels of content nesting. However, they should be used sparingly to avoid visual clutter. <strong>Minimal</strong> <strong>Usage</strong> <strong>Heading</strong> The h6 heading represents the smallest standard heading level. It is rarely used in typical documents but provides options for specialized technical or legal documentation.</p>
