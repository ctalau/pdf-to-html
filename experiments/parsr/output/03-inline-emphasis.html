<h2><strong>Inline</strong> <strong>Emphasis</strong> <strong>Examples</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Strong</strong> <strong>Emphasis</strong> <strong>(Bold)</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>quick</strong> <strong>brown</strong> <strong>fox</strong> jumps over the lazy dog. When you need to emphasize important terms or keywords in your text, the <strong>strong</strong> <strong>element</strong> is the semantic choice. It indicates content of <strong>great</strong> <strong>importance</strong> to the reader and is typically displayed in bold font weight.</p>

<p><strong>Emphasized</strong> <strong>Text</strong> <strong>(Italic)</strong></p>

<p>The restaurant received an <em>excellent</em> review in the local newspaper. Italicized text using the <em>em</em> <em>element</em> is used to emphasize content that should be read with <em>stress</em> <em>or</em> <em>importance</em> in a conversational tone, such as titles, technical terms, or foreign phrases.</p>

<p><strong>Underlined</strong> <strong>Text</strong></p>

<p>This document was last updated on February 21, 2026 and should be reviewed accordingly. The underline element can be used to highlight important references or to indicate dates and time-sensitive information that requires special attention from the reader.</p>

<p><strong>Strikethrough</strong> <strong>Text</strong></p>

<p>The original price was $99.99 now available for just $49.99. We removed the old methodology and abandoned the deprecated API in favor of the new architecture. Strikethrough is useful for showing revisions, corrections, or obsolete information that is being replaced.</p>

<p><strong>Combined</strong> <strong>Emphasis</strong> <strong>Types</strong></p>

<p>The team worked on several tasks including <strong>developing</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>core</strong> <strong>infrastructure,</strong> <em>documenting</em> <em>the</em> <em>API,</em> testing all edge cases, and <strong>ensuring</strong> <strong>code</strong> <strong>quality</strong> <strong>standards.</strong> In fact, the most <em><strong>critical</strong></em> <em><strong>requirement</strong></em> was to deliver <strong>production-ready</strong> <strong>code</strong> that was both well-documented and thoroughly tested. The <em><strong>final</strong></em> <em><strong>milestone</strong></em> included <strong>deploying</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>live</strong> <strong>environment,</strong> <em>monitoring</em> <em>performance</em> <em>metrics,</em> and removing temporary workarounds that were used during development.</p>
