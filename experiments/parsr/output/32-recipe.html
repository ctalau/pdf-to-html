<p><strong>Chef&#x27;s</strong> <strong>Tips</strong></p>

<p>For the best results, use beef chuck which has the right amount of marbling for a tender, flavorful stew. Make this dish a day ahead and reheat—the flavors deepen overnight. You can also slow-cook this in a slow cooker on low for 6-8 hours instead of braising in the oven.</p>
