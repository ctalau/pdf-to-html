<h2><strong>Image</strong> <strong>Alignment</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Text</strong> <strong>Wrapping</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Centered</strong> <strong>Image</strong></h3>

<p>Sample Image 1</p>

<p><em>Figure</em> <em>1:</em> <em>A</em> <em>centered</em> <em>image</em> <em>showing</em> <em>the</em> <em>main</em> <em>concept</em> This section demonstrates how centered images interact with surrounding text. When an image is centered, it creates a clear visual break in the content while maintaining document flow. The text above and below the image remains at full width, creating a balanced layout that draws attention to the image as a key visual element.</p>

<p>Centered images are particularly useful for highlighting important diagrams, photographs, or illustrations that warrant dedicated space. The viewer&#x27;s eye is naturally drawn to the center of the page, making this alignment choice effective for featured content that should not compete with surrounding text.</p>

<p>In professional documents, centered alignment is commonly used for title pages, section breaks, and prominent figures that require focused attention. This approach helps organize information hierarchy and guides the reader through the document structure.</p>

<h3><strong>Right-Aligned</strong> <strong>Image</strong> <strong>with</strong> <strong>Text</strong> <strong>Wrapping</strong></h3>

<p>This section demonstrates the right-aligned floating image technique. When an image is floated to the right, surrounding text naturally wraps Image 2 around it on the left side. This creates a more integrated layout where text and images share the same vertical space. The floating technique is widely used in newspapers, magazines, and modern web design to create dynamic, visually engaging layouts. <em>Figure</em> <em>2:</em> <em>Right-aligned</em> <em>illustration</em></p>

<p>The right alignment draws the reader&#x27;s eye outward as they progress through the text, providing visual interest without disrupting the reading flow. Text wraps around the image, maintaining readability while</p>

<p>creating an efficient use of space. This technique is particularly effective for supplementary images that complement the text without requiring complete separation.</p>

<p>Professional publications use right-aligned images to create sidebar effects, where related visual content accompanies explanatory text. The clear separation between the image margin and text ensures readability while the floating effect allows for flexible page layouts that adapt to different content combinations.</p>

<p>The wrapping effect continues naturally around the image, providing a seamless integration of visual and textual elements. This approach requires careful consideration of margin spacing to ensure neither element visually overlaps the other.</p>

<h3><strong>Left-Aligned</strong> <strong>Image</strong> <strong>with</strong> <strong>Text</strong> <strong>Wrapping</strong></h3>

<p>This final section showcases the left-aligned floating image layout. When images are positioned on the left with text flowing around the Image 3 right side, it creates a strong visual anchor that guides the reader&#x27;s attention. This layout is frequently used in technical documentation, instructional materials, and content-heavy publications where multiple <em>Figure</em> <em>3:</em> <em>Left-aligned</em> <em>visual</em> images need to be integrated with explanatory text. <em>element</em> The left alignment can create a sense of forward momentum as the reader&#x27;s eye moves from image to text, then down to the next section. This technique is particularly effective for step-by-step guides or processes where visual illustrations complement sequential instructions. The consistent positioning helps establish a rhythm in the document design.</p>

<p>Many professional layouts alternate between left and right aligned images to create visual variety while maintaining structured organization. This approach prevents monotony and helps segment content into logical, visually distinct sections that are easier to navigate and understand.</p>

<p>The careful spacing around floating elements ensures that the text remains readable and the images maintain visual prominence without overwhelming the layout. This balance between visual and textual elements is crucial for creating professional, accessible documents.</p>
