Licensee shall not use the Software in any manner that could damage, disable, or impair the Software or any systems connected thereto. c. Licensee acknowledges that the Software contains valuable trade secrets and proprietary information of the Licensor and shall maintain the confidentiality of such information. d. Any violation of these restrictions shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and shall result in immediate termination of the license grant. 3. Intellectual Property Rights a. The Software and all copies thereof are proprietary to the Licensor and all right, title, and interest in the Software, including all intellectual property rights therein, remain with the Licensor. b. Licensee acknowledges that no title to the intellectual property in the Software is transferred to Licensee by virtue of this Agreement or the delivery of the Software to Licensee. c. Licensee shall not register, license, or claim ownership of the Software, trademarks, or any other intellectual property rights in the Software. d. This Agreement does not authorize Licensee to use the Licensor&#x27;s name, trademark, logo, or other marks without express written consent of the Licensor. 4. Term and Termination a. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of one (1) year unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions hereof (&quot;Initial Term&quot;). b. This Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one-year periods (each a &quot;Renewal Term&quot;) unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term.</p>

<p>c. Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of written notice. d. Upon termination, all rights granted to Licensee shall immediately cease, and Licensee shall promptly return or certify destruction of all copies of the Software. 5.
