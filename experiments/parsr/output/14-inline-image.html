<h2><strong>Using</strong> <strong>Inline</strong> <strong>Images</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>Text</strong></h2>

<p>This paragraph contains a small inline icon that illustrates a successful operation. The icon is positioned mid-sentence and maintains the baseline of the text. <strong>Figure</strong> <strong>A</strong> This technique works well for small indicators, checkmarks, or status symbols that enhance readability without disrupting flow.</p>

<p>The second paragraph includes a larger image that expands the line height. This larger element represents a diagram or illustration embedded directly within the text flow. <strong>Figure</strong> <strong>B</strong> Notice how the lines accommodate the extra height. The browser automatically adjusts spacing to prevent overlap, demonstrating responsive inline placement of variable-sized graphical content.</p>

<p>When designed properly, inline images enhance content comprehension without requiring readers to navigate to separate figures or appendices. They&#x27;re particularly useful in technical documentation, instructional materials, and accessibility-focused documents where context matters as much as the visual representation itself.</p>
