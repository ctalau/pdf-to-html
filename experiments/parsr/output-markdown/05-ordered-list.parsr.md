# Step-by-Step Instructions

### Classic Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe

1. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and prepare baking sheets by lining them with
parchment paper.
2. In a large mixing bowl, cream together one cup of softened butter with three-quarters cup of
granulated sugar and three-quarters cup of packed brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy.
3. Beat in two large eggs one at a time, then add one teaspoon of vanilla extract and mix until
thoroughly combined.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together two and one-quarter cups of all-purpose flour, one teaspoon of
baking soda, and one teaspoon of fine sea salt.
5. Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined, being careful not to
overmix the dough.
6. Stir in two cups of chocolate chips, one cup of chopped walnuts, and one teaspoon of cinnamon
until evenly distributed throughout.
7. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about two
inches apart to allow room for spreading.
8. Bake for nine to eleven minutes until the edges are golden brown but the centers still appear
slightly underdone, then transfer to cooling racks.
