<h1>Inline Emphasis Examples</h1>
<p>Strong Emphasis (Bold)</p>
<p>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. When you need to emphasize important terms or keywords in your text, the strong element is the semantic choice. It indicates content of great importance to the reader and is typically displayed in bold font weight.</p>
<p>Emphasized Text (Italic)</p>
<p>The restaurant received an excellent review in the local newspaper. Italicized text using the em element is used to emphasize content that should be read with stress or importance in a conversational tone, such as titles, technical terms, or foreign phrases.</p>
<p>Underlined Text</p>
<p>This document was last updated on February 21, 2026 and should be reviewed accordingly. The underline element can be used to highlight important references or to indicate dates and time-sensitive information that requires special attention from the reader.</p>
<p>Strikethrough Text</p>
<p>The original price was $99.99 now available for just $49.99. We removed the old methodology and abandoned the deprecated API in favor of the new architecture. Strikethrough is useful for showing revisions, corrections, or obsolete information that is being replaced.</p>
<p>Combined Emphasis Types</p>
<p>The team worked on several tasks including developing the core infrastructure, documenting the API, testing all edge cases, and ensuring code quality standards. In fact, the most critical requirement was to deliver production-ready code that was both well-documented and thoroughly tested. The final milestone included deploying to the live environment, monitoring performance metrics, and removing temporary workarounds that were used during development.</p>
