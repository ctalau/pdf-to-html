<h1>Step-by-Step Instructions</h1>
<h3>Classic Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe</h3>
<p>1. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and prepare baking sheets by lining them with</p>
<p>parchment paper.</p>
<p>2. In a large mixing bowl, cream together one cup of softened butter with three-quarters cup of</p>
<p>granulated sugar and three-quarters cup of packed brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy.</p>
<p>3. Beat in two large eggs one at a time, then add one teaspoon of vanilla extract and mix until</p>
<p>thoroughly combined.</p>
<p>4. In a separate bowl, whisk together two and one-quarter cups of all-purpose flour, one teaspoon of</p>
<p>baking soda, and one teaspoon of fine sea salt.</p>
<p>5. Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined, being careful not to</p>
<p>overmix the dough.</p>
<p>6. Stir in two cups of chocolate chips, one cup of chopped walnuts, and one teaspoon of cinnamon</p>
<p>until evenly distributed throughout.</p>
<p>7. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about two</p>
<p>inches apart to allow room for spreading.</p>
<p>8. Bake for nine to eleven minutes until the edges are golden brown but the centers still appear</p>
<p>slightly underdone, then transfer to cooling racks.</p>
