<h1>Step-by-Step Instructions</h1>
<h3>Classic Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and prepare baking sheets by lining them with
parchment paper.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together one cup of softened butter with three-quarters cup of
granulated sugar and three-quarters cup of packed brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy.</li>
<li>Beat in two large eggs one at a time, then add one teaspoon of vanilla extract and mix until
thoroughly combined.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, whisk together two and one-quarter cups of all-purpose flour, one teaspoon of
baking soda, and one teaspoon of fine sea salt.</li>
<li>Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined, being careful not to
overmix the dough.</li>
<li>Stir in two cups of chocolate chips, one cup of chopped walnuts, and one teaspoon of cinnamon
until evenly distributed throughout.</li>
<li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about two
inches apart to allow room for spreading.</li>
<li>Bake for nine to eleven minutes until the edges are golden brown but the centers still appear
slightly underdone, then transfer to cooling racks.</li>
