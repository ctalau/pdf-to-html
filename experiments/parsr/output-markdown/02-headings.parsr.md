Understanding Headings Proper heading hierarchy is essential for document organization. Headings should follow a logical sequence from h1 to h6, creating clear visual and structural distinctions between content sections. Secondary Section Structure This heading level is useful for organizing subsections within your main content areas. It provides a clear visual distinction while maintaining readability and document flow. Tertiary Information Grouping The h4 heading level allows for further subdivision of content. It is particularly useful in longer documents where multiple levels of organization are needed to maintain clarity. Lesser-Used Heading Levels Heading levels five and six are available for highly structured documents with many levels of content nesting. However, they should be used sparingly to avoid visual clutter. Minimal Usage Heading The h6 heading represents the smallest standard heading level. It is rarely used in typical documents but provides options for specialized technical or legal documentation.
