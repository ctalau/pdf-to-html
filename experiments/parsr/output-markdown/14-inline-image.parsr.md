# Using Inline Images in Text

This paragraph contains a small inline icon that illustrates a successful operation. The icon is positioned mid-sentence and maintains the baseline of the text. Figure A This technique works well for small indicators, checkmarks, or status symbols that enhance readability without disrupting flow.

The second paragraph includes a larger image that expands the line height. This larger element represents a diagram or illustration embedded directly within the text flow. Figure B Notice how the lines accommodate the extra height. The browser automatically adjusts spacing to prevent overlap, demonstrating responsive inline placement of variable-sized graphical content.

When designed properly, inline images enhance content comprehension without requiring readers to navigate to separate figures or appendices. They're particularly useful in technical documentation, instructional materials, and accessibility-focused documents where context matters as much as the visual representation itself.
