    <h1>Inline Emphasis Examples</h1>

    <div class="section-title">Strong Emphasis (Bold)</div>
    <p>The <strong>quick brown fox</strong> jumps over the lazy dog. When you need to emphasize important terms or keywords in your text, the <strong>strong element</strong> is the semantic choice. It indicates content of <strong>great importance</strong> to the reader and is typically displayed in bold font weight.</p>

    <div class="section-title">Emphasized Text (Italic)</div>
    <p>The restaurant received an <em>excellent</em> review in the local newspaper. Italicized text using the <em>em element</em> is used to emphasize content that should be read with <em>stress or importance</em> in a conversational tone, such as titles, technical terms, or foreign phrases.</p>

    <div class="section-title">Underlined Text</div>
    <p>This document was <u>last updated on February 21, 2026</u> and should be reviewed accordingly. The underline element can be used to <u>highlight important references</u> or to indicate <u>dates and time-sensitive information</u> that requires special attention from the reader.</p>

    <div class="section-title">Strikethrough Text</div>
    <p>The original price was <s>$99.99</s> now available for just $49.99. We removed the old methodology and <s>abandoned the deprecated API</s> in favor of the new architecture. Strikethrough is useful for showing revisions, corrections, or <s>obsolete information</s> that is being replaced.</p>

    <div class="section-title">Combined Emphasis Types</div>
    <p>The team worked on several tasks including <strong>developing the core infrastructure</strong>, <em>documenting the API</em>, <u>testing all edge cases</u>, and <span style="font-weight: bold">ensuring code quality standards</span>. In fact, the most <strong><em>critical requirement</em></strong> was to deliver <strong>production-ready code</strong> that was both <u>well-documented</u> and thoroughly tested. The <strong><em>final milestone</em></strong> included <span style="font-weight: bold">deploying to the live environment</span>, <em>monitoring performance metrics</em>, and <s>removing temporary workarounds</s> that were used during development.</p>
