    <h1>Programming Best Practices</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Essential techniques for writing maintainable and efficient code</p>

    <p>
        Modern software development relies on understanding fundamental programming constructs and their proper usage.
        When writing JavaScript, it is crucial to learn how to use the built-in methods effectively. For instance,
        to transform an array of numbers, you would use <code>Array.prototype.map()</code> to apply a function to each
        element without mutating the original array. This functional approach prevents side effects and makes code
        easier to reason about. Additionally, many developers prefer <code>const</code> declarations over <code>var</code>
        to maintain block scoping and prevent accidental reassignments.
    </p>

    <p>
        Keyboard shortcuts and command-line interactions form an integral part of a developer's daily workflow.
        When working in most text editors, pressing <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> saves your current file, while <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd>
        undoes the last action. On macOS systems, these commands are mapped to <kbd>Cmd+S</kbd> and <kbd>Cmd+Z</kbd>
        respectively. Understanding these shortcuts significantly improves productivity and reduces reliance on mouse
        navigation. Furthermore, advanced users often memorize terminal shortcuts like <kbd>Ctrl+A</kbd> to jump to
        the beginning of a line and <kbd>Ctrl+E</kbd> to jump to the end, making command-line work much more efficient.
    </p>

    <p>
        In algorithm design and data structure implementation, carefully chosen variable names make code self-documenting.
        Consider a sorting function where the variable <var>pivot</var> represents the element around which partitioning
        occurs, or a search algorithm where <var>left</var> and <var>right</var> track the boundaries of the current
        search space. The variable <var>accumulator</var> is commonly used in reduce operations to build up a final result
        from intermediate computations. When implementing recursive algorithms, the variable <var>depth</var> often tracks
        how many levels of recursion have been traversed. These naming conventions, combined with proper use of <code>let</code>
        and <code>const</code>, create code that is both performant and readable.
