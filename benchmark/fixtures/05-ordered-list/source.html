    <h2>Classic Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and prepare baking sheets by lining them with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together one cup of softened butter with three-quarters cup of granulated sugar and three-quarters cup of packed brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Beat in two large eggs one at a time, then add one teaspoon of vanilla extract and mix until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together two and one-quarter cups of all-purpose flour, one teaspoon of baking soda, and one teaspoon of fine sea salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined, being careful not to overmix the dough.</li>
        <li>Stir in two cups of chocolate chips, one cup of chopped walnuts, and one teaspoon of cinnamon until evenly distributed throughout.</li>
        <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about two inches apart to allow room for spreading.</li>
        <li>Bake for nine to eleven minutes until the edges are golden brown but the centers still appear slightly underdone, then transfer to cooling racks.</li>
    </ol>
