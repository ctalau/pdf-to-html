    <h1>Ancient Civilizations and Scientific Discovery</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">An exploration of how early societies contributed to human knowledge</p>

    <p>
        The ancient civilizations that flourished along major river systems made extraordinary contributions to human
        knowledge and understanding of the natural world. The Egyptians, Mesopotamians, and Chinese developed sophisticated
        systems for tracking celestial movements, measuring land, and calculating architectural proportions
        <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup>. These early scientific endeavors, while not always framed in modern
        terminology, represented systematic attempts to understand and manipulate natural phenomena for practical purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Egyptian mathematics and engineering prowess is evident in the precision of their monumental architecture. The Great
        Pyramid of Giza, constructed around 2560 BCE, demonstrates remarkable geometric understanding and construction techniques
        that continue to fascinate modern researchers. The Egyptians developed a system of fractions and geometric principles
        that allowed them to survey land after annual Nile floods and calculate volumes for granaries and monuments
        <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">[2]</a></sup>. Their papyri reveal detailed instructions for mathematical and practical problems,
        suggesting a formalized system of education for scribes and engineers.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Mesopotamia, the Sumerians and Babylonians made comparable contributions to human understanding, particularly in the
        areas of astronomy and mathematics. The Babylonians developed sophisticated arithmetical procedures and geometric concepts,
        including early forms of algebra and the famous sexagesimal system (base-60) that we still use for measuring time and angles
        <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">[3]</a></sup>. Their clay tablets, preserved through millennia, contain astronomical records and
        predictions of lunar eclipses, demonstrating a deep observational knowledge of celestial mechanics.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Chinese civilization independently developed advanced mathematical and astronomical knowledge. Chinese mathematicians
        created sophisticated computational methods, including early forms of matrix algebra and negative number systems, centuries
        before similar concepts appeared in Western mathematics. The development of the astronomical clock and detailed star catalogs
        in ancient China reflects a sustained commitment to understanding the cosmos
        <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">[4]</a></sup>. This parallel development of mathematical and scientific thinking in different
        parts of the world suggests that systematic investigation of natural phenomena is a fundamental aspect of human cognition.
    </p>

    <p>
        These ancient contributions form the foundation upon which modern science was built. The methodologies developed by early
        civilizations—careful observation, systematic recording, mathematical modeling, and practical experimentation—remain central
        to scientific practice today. Understanding this history reminds us that the scientific method was not invented in a single moment
        but developed gradually through the accumulated efforts of many cultures over millennia.

                The astronomical alignment of Egyptian temples and the precise cardinal orientation of the pyramids provide compelling
                evidence of sophisticated astronomical knowledge. These achievements required advanced mathematical understanding and
                long-term observational data.

                The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, dating to approximately 1650 BCE, contains eighty-seven mathematical problems demonstrating
                Egyptian proficiency in geometry, fractions, and practical calculation methods used in construction and land management.

                The sexagesimal system developed by the Babylonians was so effective that it persists in modern usage: 60 seconds per minute,
                60 minutes per hour, and 360 degrees in a circle. This system enabled precise astronomical calculations and geometric measurements.

                Ancient Chinese texts such as the Huainanzi contain sophisticated astronomical observations and theoretical explanations for
